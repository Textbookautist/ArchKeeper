Keyword ideas

Currently the keywords are simply shoved into a single file, line by line.
But more long-term mechanic would be to have a keyword creator, similar to item creator itself.
Having the keyword TYPE as well could be beneficial. Item keyword, feature keyword, spell keyword.

This would allow the creator to not only attach keywords to the items, but all the stuff that is attached to that keyword.
Instead of an item only being given "+1" keyword, that keyword itself would attach "Attack and damage rolls made with this weapon gain a +1 bonus" trait.
