item ideas

Just realized that it would probably be better to separate the keywords displayed in item profiles.

Currently it looks like "Word, Word, Word, Word" but I now know I can separate the keywords to their own labels, making the reading more intuitive.
Even better: Insert the keyword into a button that links to the codex-entry of that keyword. LOOK INTO "Keyword ideas"-NOTE if you want more information about this.
